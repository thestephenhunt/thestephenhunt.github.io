      <h1>Work I've been a part of...</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Bank of America</h3>
          <p>I worked on a onboarding form to bring in new small business clients.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Nurocor</h3>
          <p>I completed a UI redesign on our oldest current product, replacing an old
            component library with a new one, and writing new components. I was on the team that built the UI of a platform-wide notification service.I helped build and update components within our custom component library using Storybook. I was a part of a transition to Typescript across our platform.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Cox Automotive</h3>
          <p>I created new feature for determining which cars on a dealer’s lot are hot or
            not utilizing React, AWS, and Java. I helped refactor tracking system for new internal framework based on React using Javascript. I maintained and added to the Ford specific design variation utilizing SCSS. I collaborated as a leader for an internal development education initiative. I built a Slack bot on free time to bring together multiple sources of documentation</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>DirecTV Latin America</h3>
          <p>I built out the front-end redesign for DirecTV’s Latin American site leveraging
            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular 5 and PHP. I set up the base installation and built components for a website utilizing Angular 5. I built a small design system doc website with Kirby CMS. I created a custom style guide leveraged internally using Bootstrap. I collaborated directly with a designer to convert PSDs to websites. All projects listed above were developed to be responsive</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Inked Brands</h3>
          <p>I created view templates for new features on their custom-built platform (Ruby
            on Rails) that enhanced and improved the user experience. 90% of SCSS maintained affected the entire platform, and was shared across multiple sites. I turned designs from the UX/UI team into responsive pages. I helped initiate the platform-wide conversion to from jQuery to JavaScript.

          <p>I leveraged PHP and MySQL for WordPress projects, and C# and MySQL on
            different projects with the .NET team. All projects were built to be compatible with IE8+ browsers. I collaborated with back-end engineers on both WordPress and C# platforms,
            and bridged the gap between design and function. I committed changes to an in-house custom theme with a custom framework, which resulted in more concise and mobile friendly code. I created several sites from scratch based on the platform, and was responsible for site maintenance for those projects</p>
